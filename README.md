I am a doctoral researcher at the [Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis (CMVS)](https://www.oulu.fi/cmvs/) in the [University of Oulu](https://www.oulu.fi/university/), Finland.

I have been intensively involving in several compture vision and machine learning projects. I have been working with [Assisstant Professor Li Liu](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~lili/LiLiuHomepage.html). My research interest includes efficient representation learning, few-shot learning, contactless health monitoring, and face and behavior analysis. I have published several papers in top tier conferences and journals, such as IJCV, ICCV, ECCV, and ACCV. As an active member of IEEE and Pattern Recogntion Society, I have been serving as a reviewer for IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, Pattern Recognition, Pattern Recognition Letters, etc.
